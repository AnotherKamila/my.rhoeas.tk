  "readme": "# Groove Basin\n\nNo-nonsense music client and server for your home or office.\n\nRun it on a server connected to your main speakers. Guests can connect with\ntheir laptops, tablets, and phones, and play and share music.\n\nDepends on [mpd](http://musicpd.org) version 0.17+ for the backend. Some might\ncall this project an mpd client. (Note, version 0.17 is only available from\nsource as of writing this; see below instructions regarding mpd installation.)\n\nLive demo: [groovebasin.com](http://groovebasin.com/)\n\n## Features\n\n* Lightning-fast, responsive UI. You can hardly tell that the music server is\n  on another computer.\n\n* Dynamic playlist mode which automatically queues random songs, favoring\n  songs that have not been played recently.\n\n* Drag and drop upload. Drag and drop playlist editing. Rich keyboard\n  shortcuts.\n\n* Streaming support. You can listen to your music library - or share it with\n  your friends - even when you are not physically near your home speakers.\n\n* Last.fm scrobbling.\n\n## Get Started\n\nMake sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](http://npmjs.org)\ninstalled and [mpd](http://musicpd.org) version 0.17+ (see below) running,\nthen:\n\n```\n$ npm install groovebasin\n$ npm start groovebasin\n```\n\nAt this point, Groove Basin will issue warnings telling you what to do next.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![Search + drag/drop support](http://www.superjoesoftware.com/temp/groove-basin-0.0.4.png)\n![Multi-select and context menu](http://www.superjoesoftware.com/temp/groove-basin-0.0.4-lib-menu.png)\n![Keyboard shortcuts](http://www.superjoesoftware.com/temp/groove-basin-0.0.4-shortcuts.png)\n![Last.fm Scrobbling](http://www.superjoesoftware.com/temp/groove-basin-0.0.4-lastfm.png)\n\n## Mpd\n\nGroove Basin depends on [mpd](http://musicpd.org) version 0.17+.\n\nTo compile from source, start here\n\n```\n$ git clone git://git.musicpd.org/master/mpd.git\n```\n\nand follow mpd's instructions from there.\n\n### Configuration\n\n* `default_permissions` - Recommended to remove `admin` so that anonymous\n  users can't do nefarious things.\n\n* `password` - Recommended to add a password for yourself to give yourself `admin` permissions.\n\n   * `read` - allows reading the library, current playlist, and playback status.\n\n   * `add` - allows adding songs, loading playlists, and uploading songs. \n\n   * `control` - allows controlling playback state and manipulating playlists.\n\n   * `admin` - allows updating the db, killing mpd, deleting songs from the\n     library, and updating song tags.\n\n* `audio_output` - Uncomment the \"httpd\" one and configure the port to enable\n  streaming. Recommended \"vorbis\" encoder for better browser support.\n\n* `sticker_file` - Groove Basin will not run without one set.\n\n* `gapless_mp3_playback` - \"yes\" recommended. <3 gapless playback.\n\n* `volume_normalization` - \"yes\" recommended. Replaygain scanners are not\n  implemented for all the formats that can be played back. Volume normalization\n  works on all formats.\n\n* `max_command_list_size` - \"16384\" recommended. You do not want mpd crashing\n  when you try to remove a ton of songs from the playlist at once.\n\n* `auto_update` - \"yes\" recommended. Required for uploaded songs to show up\n  in your library.\n\n## Configuring Groove Basin\n\nSee http://npmjs.org/doc/config.html#Per-Package-Config-Settings\n\nSee the \"config\" section of `package.json` for configuration options and\ndefaults.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n$ npm config set groovebasin:mpd_conf ~/.mpd/mpd.conf\n$ npm config set groovebasin:port 80\n$ npm -g --groovebasin:port 80 start groovebasin\n```\n\n## Developing\n\nInstall dependencies and run mpd as described in the Get Started section.\nThen, from a clean clone of the source repository:\n\n```\n$ npm run-script dev --groovebasin:development_mode true\n```\n\n## Release Notes\n\n### 0.0.6\n\n* Josh Wolfe:\n  * fixing not queuing before random when pressing enter in the search box\n  * fixing streaming hotkey not updating button ui\n  * stopping and starting streaming in sync with mpd.status.state.\n  * fixing weird bug with Stream button checked state\n  * warning when bind_to_address is not also configured for localhost\n  * fixing derpy log reference\n  * fixing negative trackNumber scrobbling\n  * directory urls download .zip files. #9\n  * document dependency on mpd version 0.17\n* Andrew Kelley:\n  * fix regression: not queuing before random songs client side\n  * uploaded songs are queued in the correct place\n  * support restarting mpd without restarting daemon\n  * ability to reconnect without refreshing\n  * log.info instead of console.info for track uploaded msg\n  * avoid the use of 'static' keyword\n* David Banham:\n  * Make jPlayer aware of which stream format is set\n  * Removed extra constructor.
